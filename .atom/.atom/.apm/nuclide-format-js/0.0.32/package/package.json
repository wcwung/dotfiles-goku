Right now all of the codemods\nlive in the `nuclide-format-js-base` package.\n\n## usage\n\nThe default keyboard shortcut for `nuclide-format-js:format` is `cmd-shift-i`.\n\n## codemods\n\n### requires\n\nThis collection of codemods automatically adds, removes, and formats your requires. It is primarily\na heuristic that works by requiring identifiers that are being used that were not declared. It is\nalso aware of Flow types and will properly promote type imports to requires, and demote requires to\ntype imports when appropriate.\n\nThere are a few best practices that you should follow in order to get the most benefit out of these\ntransforms:\n\n+ Don't shadow require names anywhere in the file. The transform is very minimally aware of scope.\n+ Don't alias requires (unless you specify the alias in the aliases setting).\n+ Destructure in a line separate from the require.\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\nvar {PropTypes} = React;\n```\n\nThere are also a few things that are not supported yet that would be nice to support:\n\n+ Relative requires, e.g. `require('../lib/module');`\n+ Common destructures, e.g. `var {PropTypes} = require('react');`\n+ Only add requires for known modules by maintaining a list of known modules, or by getting this\ninformation from Flow.\n+ Allow per-directory configurations.\n\nRight now the recommended set up is to not run-on-save and instead use the default\nkeyboard shortcut.\n\nMake sure to verify the requires that are added by this plugin and report any issues. If anything\nis getting in your way when using this plugin you can generally work around it by modifying the\nplugin's settings. It's possible to adjust things like built-ins, aliases, and even blacklist\nparticular transforms there.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-format-js/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-format-js#readme","_id":"nuclide-format-js@0.0.32","_shasum":"ca362e2ac36d9aa9f0dc1031c66ec30079dfbef7","_resolved":"file:../d-115825-44677-xazy9v/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115825-44677-xazy9v/package.tgz"}
